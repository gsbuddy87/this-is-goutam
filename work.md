### Software Architecture & Development

I specialize in designing scalable and maintainable systems, primarily using Java. My approach balances **clarity, simplicity, and future-proofing**.  

I have experience in:  
- System architecture design  
- Backend development with Java  
- Code reviews and mentorship  
- Refactoring complex systems

> Every architecture is a blueprint for understanding — my goal is to make systems predictable and readable.
