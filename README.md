# This Is Goutam Portfolio

Welcome to Goutam's personal project and portfolio website! This site is built with Jekyll to serve as a fast and responsive personal hub.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Film & Photography Galleries**: Highlighting visual arts passion.
- **Technical Blogs**: A section to share knowledge and tech journeys.
- **Work & Travel Documentation**: Logs of professional work and travel experiences.
- **Responsive Layout**: Designed to look clean on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🚀 Local Development Setup

This project uses Jekyll (via the `github-pages` gem) for building the site natively. Follow these steps to set up and run the site locally:

### Prerequisites
- **Ruby** (Version specified in `.ruby-version`, typically `3.3.5`).
- **Bundler** (`gem install bundler`).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd this-is-goutam
   ```
2. Install the necessary Ruby gems:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

### Running the Server
Start the local Jekyll development server:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```
The site should now be running at `http://localhost:4000/`.
