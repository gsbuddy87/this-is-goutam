I am passionate about filmmaking and visual storytelling. I directed a short film (available on YouTube) and worked as a cameraman on two other short films directed by friends.  

I enjoy exploring perspectives, lighting, and composition — the same way I approach software: with **structure, intention, and attention to detail**.
