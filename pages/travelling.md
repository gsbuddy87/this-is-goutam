            Travel has always been my quiet obsession, a way of listening to the world as it speaks in different tongues, colors, and rhythms. Each journey feels like a page torn from a diary, inked not with words but with sunsets, temple bells, and the laughter of strangers.

            In recent times, my footsteps have carried me across India’s many moods. I have stood before the <strong>Taj Mahal in Agra</strong>, where marble seemed to breathe love into the air. I have wandered through <strong>Rajasthan’s deserts</strong>, where forts rise like mirages of history. In <strong>Haridwar</strong>, the Ganga shimmered with devotion, while <strong>Dehradun and Mussoorie</strong> wrapped me in mist and mountain silence. <strong>Manali’s snow</strong> whispered of winter dreams, and <strong>Sikkim’s monasteries</strong> taught me the language of stillness.

            <strong>West Bengal</strong>, my native land, is where my roots always call me back, even as <strong>Bengaluru and Pune</strong> became second homes through the rhythm of work. <strong>Mumbai</strong>, restless and alive, reminded me that dreams never sleep. And in <strong>Benaras</strong>, I felt time dissolve—the river flowing eternal, the chants rising like smoke into the sky.

                Beyond India, travel has opened other doors. With my wife, I wandered through <strong>Thailand</strong>—Bangkok’s vibrant chaos, Phuket’s golden sands, Krabi’s serene waters—all moments richer because they were shared.

                In <strong>Munich, Germany</strong>, I walked alone, a business trip that became a quiet meditation on history and solitude, where even the cobblestones seemed to carry stories.

            These are only some of the places that come to mind now, recent chapters in a much longer tale. I have journeyed through many more, each destination leaving behind a trace—sometimes a fragrance, sometimes a melody, sometimes just a fleeting feeling that lingers.

            For me, travel is not about destinations marked on a map. It is about the way the world enters you, reshapes you, and stays within you. It is about carrying rivers in your memory, mountains in your breath, and cities in your heartbeat. Every journey is a reminder that life is vast, beautiful, and endlessly worth exploring.
