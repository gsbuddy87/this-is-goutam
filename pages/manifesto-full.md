            <h3 style="color: #330066; margin-bottom: 1rem;">1. Architecture as Art and Science</h3>
            <p>I see software architecture not just as engineering, but as a discipline that blends logic with creativity. My mission is to design end‑to‑end systems that are robust, scalable, and adaptable—systems that solve today’s problems while anticipating tomorrow’s challenges. Every blueprint I create is guided by clarity, precision, and a relentless drive to simplify complexity.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #330066; margin-bottom: 1rem;">2. Problem-Solving as Core Philosophy</h3>
            <p>Technology is valuable only when it solves real problems. My strength lies in breaking down intricate challenges into elegant solutions—whether in banking, retail, insurance, or rail. I believe in building architectures that are not only technically sound but also aligned with business goals, ensuring that innovation translates into measurable impact.</p>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            <h3 style="color: #330066; margin-bottom: 1rem;">3. Generative AI as the Next Frontier</h3>
            <p>The rise of Generative AI marks a turning point in how we design and interact with systems. My current focus on Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) is driven by the vision of creating intelligent architectures that can harness enterprise knowledge, deliver contextual insights, and redefine user experiences. I see AI as a co‑creator, augmenting human ingenuity rather than replacing it.</p>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            <h3 style="color: #330066; margin-bottom: 1rem;">4. Clarity Over Scale</h3>
            <p>For me, clarity is the foundation of great design. A system that is clear in purpose, structure, and communication will always outlast one that merely scales without direction. I believe that simplicity breeds resilience: when design choices are transparent and intentional, systems remain adaptable, maintainable, and meaningful. Scale is important, but clarity ensures that scale does not become chaos.</p>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            <h3 style="color: #330066; margin-bottom: 1rem;">5. Domain Expertise as Foundation</h3>
            <p>Each industry I’ve worked in—banking, retail, insurance, rail—has taught me that technology must adapt to context. My manifesto is rooted in the belief that domain knowledge is essential for building meaningful solutions. By combining technical mastery with industry insight, I aim to craft architectures that resonate with the unique rhythms of each sector.</p>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            <h3 style="color: #330066; margin-bottom: 1rem;">6. Continuous Evolution</h3>
            <p>Technology is never static, and neither am I. I embrace new paradigms, from microservices to cloud-native design, from DevOps automation to AI‑driven architectures. My commitment is to stay ahead of the curve, to experiment boldly, and to integrate emerging technologies into practical, scalable solutions.</p>
