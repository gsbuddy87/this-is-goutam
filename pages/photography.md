        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            Photography, for me, has never been about the mechanics of a camera—it has always been about the quiet magic of seeing. I began with a <strong>Nikon D5100</strong>, a faithful companion that taught me patience and wonder. The 18–55mm lens let me explore the everyday, while the 70–200mm opened doors to distance, detail, and drama. Each click was a lesson in light, each frame a reminder that beauty often hides in plain sight.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            Over time, I realized that the true lens is not made of glass and metal—it is the eye, the heart, the way one chooses to look at the world. That’s why today, on short trips, I often carry only my <strong>iPhone</strong>. It’s not about the gear; it’s about the vision. A fleeting shadow, a burst of color, a smile caught between moments—these are treasures no megapixel count can measure.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                Photography has become my way of listening to the world. It slows me down, asks me to notice, and teaches me that perfection is not the goal. The goal is presence.

                Whether through a DSLR or a phone, I chase not the sharpest image but the truest one—the one that reflects how I felt when I pressed the shutter.

            In the end, the best camera is the one you carry within yourself. My love for photography is simply my love for seeing, for remembering, for turning the ordinary into something eternal.
