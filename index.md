I’m a software architect with a background in Java development, based in Kolkata. I focus on designing systems that are simple, dependable, and easy to reason about — systems that retain clarity as they grow.

My work is guided by structure and intent: clear boundaries, deliberate trade-offs, and architectures that support long-term maintainability rather than short-term gains.

Outside of software, I enjoy travelling, watching films closely, and exploring visual storytelling through filmmaking and photography.
